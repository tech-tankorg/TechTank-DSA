    Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

    [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
    [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.

    Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

    Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

    You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

    ================================================================
    Constraints 
    n == nums.length
    All the integers of nums are unique.
    nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.


    ================================================================
    Example
    min_rotated_sorted_array([3,4,5,1,2]) -> 1
    min_rotated_sorted_array([4,5,6,7,0,1,2]) -> 0
    min_rotated_sorted_array([11,13,15,17]) -> 11
