    You are given an array of strings tokens that represents an arithmetic expression in a Reverse Polish Notation.
    Evaluate the expression. Return an integer that represents the value of the expression.

    Note that:
        - The valid operators are '+', '-', '*', and '/'.
        - Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
        - The division between two integers always truncates toward zero.
        - There will not be any division by zero.
        - The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in a reverse polish notation.
        - The answer and all the intermediate calculations can be represented in a 32-bit integer.


    Constraints:
        - tokens[i] is either an operator: "+", "-", "*", or "/", or an integer in the range [-200, 200].

    Example:
        reverse_polish_notation(["2","1","+","3","*"]) - > 9
        reverse_polish_notation(["4","13","5","/","+"]) -> 6
        reverse_polish_notation(["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]) -> 22

};
