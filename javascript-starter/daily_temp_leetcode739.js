  Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer [i] is the
  number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is
  possible, keep answer [i] == 0
  
  Example

  dailyTemperature([73,74, 75, 71,69, 72,76, 73]) -> [1,1,4,2,1,1, 0, 0]
  dailyTemperature([30,40,50,60]) -> [1,1,1,0]
  dailyTemperature([30,60,90]) -> [1,1,0]
